## Task results

Though the tasks do not natively carry thier `key` value in a column, public task reads and mutations return tasks with a derived `key`, like `APP-1`.

Internally, the DB functions still return task rows without `key`. Relation lookups include task records with keys when called with `{ include: { tasks: true } }`.
